## Security Best Practices

When using NeuronDB:

1. **Access Control**: Use PostgreSQL role-based access control
2. **Encryption**: Enable SSL/TLS for all connections
3. **Updates**: Keep PostgreSQL and NeuronDB up to date
4. **Auditing**: Enable query logging for sensitive operations
5. **Validation**: Validate all user inputs before vector operations

## Known Security Considerations

- Vector encryption features are for demonstration; use PostgreSQL's native encryption for production
- HTTP/LLM integration requires secure credential management
- Shared memory buffers should be sized appropriately to prevent DoS

Thank you for helping keep NeuronDB secure!
