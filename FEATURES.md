## Extension-Safe Architecture

NeuronDB is built as a pure PostgreSQL extension with no core modifications:

### What We Use
- ✅ Custom data types via `CREATE TYPE`
- ✅ SQL functions via `CREATE FUNCTION`
- ✅ Shared memory via `RequestAddinShmemSpace`
- ✅ Background workers via `RegisterBackgroundWorker`
- ✅ Hooks (`planner_hook`, `set_rel_pathlist_hook`, etc.)
- ✅ SPI for database interaction
- ✅ External libraries (libcurl, OpenSSL, zlib)

### What We Cannot Do (Core-Only)
- ❌ New WAL resource managers
- ❌ Custom WAL compression formats
- ❌ Checkpoint scheduling changes
- ❌ New wait event types
- ❌ Kernel-level TDE
- ❌ Built-in autovacuum logic changes

### Workarounds Implemented
- ✅ Index-aware checkpoint behavior (periodic flush in worker)
- ✅ Crash-resumable index build (layer checkpoints)
- ✅ Application-level encryption (at type layer)
- ✅ Transparent decrypt in function calls
